    	<div><p class="sansserif">The CPU is a very important part for a computer. The CPU or (Central Processing Unit) is   the "brains" of the computer. The CPU is also known as a processor because it processes all of the computer’s calculations and instructions. Without the CPU the computer would not be able to do anything. The CPU has changed over history and modern CPU are called micro processors. They are much smaller and faster than they were back then. Microprocessors can multitask doing many calculations at once. CPU’s instructions are binary a systems of zero’s and one’s.

       	 	<th><div><p class="sansserif">  The CPU cooler’s function is to cool down the processor. It is there to transfer the heat from the CPU so the CPU does not overheat and die. There are different types of CPU coolers. There is liquid cooling and air cooling (fan). Liquid cooling uses water to absorb the heat and move it away while air cooling take the hot air around the CPU and pushes it away. Liquid cooling is much better because water absorbs heat much better than air.</p></div></th></th></tr>

RAM or random access memory is the the memory that saves the data for some time but when you turn off your computer it gets deleted (if you don’t save it).  The other type of memory is ROM read only memory. This type of memory holds memory forever such as the operating systems which is essential for the computer.
